This article explains how to rename a Rackspace Email mailbox from the Cloud Office Control Panel.

### Before you begin

If the user mailbox is set up on a local email client profile such as Outlook or Mac Mail, export the user's local profile. After the mailbox is renamed, the local profile must be recreated. Exporting the profile before renaming the mailbox prevents the loss of mail data.

### To rename a mailbox

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

2. In the Rackspace Email section, click on **Mailboxes**.

3. Click the mailbox name that you want to change.

4. In the **User Name** field, delete the existing name and enter the new name.

5. Click **Save**.

   A confirmation message is displayed.

6. If the user mailbox is set up on a local client profile, recreate the local profile from the user profile that you exported prior to renaming the mailbox.

7. Update Outlook or any mobile devices accessing this mailbox with the new name.
